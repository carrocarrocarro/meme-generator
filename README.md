# Meme Generator 

This is a simple website generating Memes. The user can input text in two input fields. The button generates a random image from a api call. The text the user writes displays on the images. I've built this project with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

This project is also a part of Scrimbas [React Basics Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). This course is aslo free and open to everyone. If you are looking into learning React I higly recommend this course.
